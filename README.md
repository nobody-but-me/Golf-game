# A Platformer game about golf.

O.k., let's try again. This game idea was born after a crazy idea I had and after a challenge from my friend M.. The engine of this game is written from scratch using OpenGL and C++. Hopefully I won't get crazy once again and change everything. If everything goes well, this game will be published at Steam Store.

# Deadline: July, 03, 2025.
